Mautic EB [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheDMSGroup/mautic-eb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheDMSGroup/mautic-eb)
=========

#### Deploy Mautic in an auto-scaling Amazon Elastic Beanstalk cluster.
![Mautic and AWS](https://i.imgur.com/LkFNgHr.jpg "Mautic and AWS")

The goal here is to make it simple and safe to scale Mautic up to millions of leads per week, 
while maintaining HIPAA & PCI compliance. Other helpful services such as CloudFlare and Newrelic are supported, but optional.

There is still much work to be done to get us to that point.

## Requirements

1) AWS EB environment running PHP 7.1 with environment variables described below.
2) AWS RDS MySQL instance (Aurora recommended, encrypted in a private VPC)
3) AWS EFS Volume (used for shared media and spool storage)

## Environment variables in Elastic Beanstalk.

    APP_URL               - The default full URL for your site.
    DB_HOST               - RDS Host.
    DB_USER               - RDS User.
    DB_PASSWD             - RDS Password.
    DB_NAME               - RDS Database name.
    DB_PORT               - RDS port.
    SECRET_KEY            - Hash key for encryption.
    MAILER_FROM_NAME      - Default "from" email name.
    MAILER_FROM_EMAIL     - Default "from" email address.
    EFS_DNS_NAME          - The full DNS of the EFS mount.
    MAUTIC_INSTALL        - Optional: Set to "1" to initialize mautic, for the first deployment only.
    NR_APM_INSTALL_KEY    - Optional: NewRelic install key for Application Monitoring.
    NR_INF_INSTALL_KEY    - Optional: NewRelic install key for Infrastructure.

### Bitbucket Pipelines / Travis CI Environment Variables
This repo can be used to automatically build and deploy Mautic to Elastic Beanstalk using Bitbucket pipelines. To do so, BitBucket Pipelines must be enabled for this repo, and the following environment variables must be added to Pipeline settings:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     - The raw AWS key ID.
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - The raw AWS Secret Access Key.
    AWS_EB_KEY            - The private SSH key for the AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment. Base64 encoded.
    APP_URL_PROD          - URL of production environment.
    APP_URL_STAGE         - URL of staging environment (optional).
    APP_URL_DEV           - URL of development environment (optional).
    APP_ENV_PROD          - Name of production environment in Elastic Beanstalk.
    APP_ENV_STAGE         - Name of staging environment in Elastic Beanstalk (optional).
    APP_ENV_DEV           - Name of development environment in Elastic Beanstalk (optional).
    NR_APPNAME            - APP name/url to report to.
    NR_API_KEY_STAGE      - The NewRelic API key for staging (optional).
    NR_API_KEY_PROD       - The NewRelic API key for production (optional).
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL     - The URL to use for sending a slack deployment notification (optional).
    CF_USER               - CloudFlare account user email (optional).
    CF_TOKEN              - CloudFlare account user API key (optional).
    CF_ZONE               - CloudFlare DNS zone to purge (optional).

### Mautic Customizations

File structure in /mautic_eb will be copied (destructively) into the /mautic folder on composer install or update.
For configuration files and other changes that cannot be plugin-based.
Similarly you can use /mautic_custom for customizations that are brand-specific.

* mautic_eb/*  -->  mautic/*
* mautic_custom/*  -->  mautic/*

Custom dependencies can be included in a root composer.custom

### Multisite Abstraction *(expirimental)*

You may need to run several "sites" off of the same Elastic Beanstalk cluster.

To that end, the RDS databases will be as follows:
* _sites
  * id 
  * active      - boolean, to indicate if the site is enabled or not.
  * name
* _domains
  * domain 
  * site_id

#### Environment variables for multisite

    EB_MULTI            - Set to true to enable multisite (off by default).
    
### Quick local setup

1. Set up local host at http://mautic.loc
2. Run: `composer install` to get all the dependencies together.
3. Create a `./mautic/.env` file containing your local database credentials. 
5. Run: `composer db-setup-dev` to create your local database.

#### Tips

`composer.custom` can be created to pull in third-party dependencies and customizations without altering this repo.
`composer custom` to update symlinks for all customizations to mautic core.
`composer less` to compile LESS styles (should you need to extend the core styles).
`composer test` to run the full codeception suite.
Do not run `composer install` from within the ./mautic folder, only in the root project folder.
